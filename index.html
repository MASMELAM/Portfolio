                            <h4>Overview: </h4>
                                <p2>This is the second engineering project I did while I was at UCF. I worked in a team of four students, and most of us barely had any experience with projects, but we learned a plethora from this experience. Our goal was to make a boat that could transport a great naval orange around UCF's reflection pond. I brainstormed ideas with my team, and we settled on a model that was similar to a catamaran. I helped with putting the boat together and soldered the wires that connected our electronics. I was also one of the main people responsible for testing the boat, since I was the only one who had knowledge in C. The speed could not go too high because it would lead to our set screw escaping, but we managed to find a sweet spot that led us past the first round of the race. As we progressed through our project, I was also responsible for preparing detailed proposals on materials and plans for the hull, hardware, and guidance system.</p2>

                                <p2>- Used OnShape (CAD software) to design my own launching mechanism, laser-cut wooden pieces, and assembled the mechanism to put on top of a TI-RSLK robot in a team.<br>- Helped code (C++) a robot in Arduino to successfully follow a line, eject ducks onto a target, and return to starting position.</p2>

                            <h4>Overview:</h4>
                                <p2>This was my first engineering project at UCF. My team and I were tasked with designing and building a launch mechanism that could launch a rubber duck at targets. We each designed our own launch mechanism in OnShape and decided that mine was the best option to use. Then we laser-cut wood and hot glued the pieces together, using a bent metal wire to serve as a dowel and balancing tool. We conducted multiple stages of testing and adjusted our sensors' sensitivity in Arduino until we were able to complete the path.</p2>
